\f0\fs26 \cf0 If you\'92re ever looking at a document in the editor and find yourself wondering where it is in the binder, you can simply tap on the title in the editor header bar. This will load up the binder with the document you were viewing in the editor selected (very much like the \'93Reveal in Binder\'94 feature of the desktop version).\
When running on the iPad, Scrivener also has an extra navigation tool: the Draft navigator. This is available whenever you are viewing a text document contained inside the Draft folder, and you open it by tapping on the icon of three lines next to the bookmarks icon in the toolbar at the bottom of the screen. The Draft navigator shows the text of all the documents in your Draft folder, each one divided by a dashed line. You can scroll through it\'97or use the navigation controls\'97and tap on the text of a document to load it into the editor. Double-tapping into a document will load it into the editor ready for editing at the place you tapped. This is a great way of seeing a quick preview of all the text in your Draft without compiling.\
Tap on \'93Scriptwriting\'94 in the binder to continue.}
